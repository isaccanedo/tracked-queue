# Under the hood

This is implemented as an *autotracked ring buffer*. This particular implementation was inspired a bit by Rust's [`VecDeque`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.51.0/std/collections/vec_deque/struct.VecDeque.html), though `TrackedQueue` has a substantially smaller API surface than `VecDeque`.

## The ring-buffer

A ring-buffer is a good choice for a queue which requires fast access to items throughout it as well as fast enqueue and dequeue operations. A na√Øve implementation of a queue would us a linked list, which has *O(1)* enqueue and dequeue operations, but *O(N)* access for arbitrary items within the list. A ring buffer, by contrast, has *O(1)* access for any item *and* maintains *O(1)* access for enqueue and dequeue operations. It also has lower space usage than a linked list: a small and fixed amount of overhead for tracking the queue's capacity and indexes for the start and end of the queue and *O(N)* backing storage, vs. a linked list's *O(3N)* backing storage, with both the data and pointers for both neighbor nodes. Finally, a ring buffer will also be laid out contiguously in memory, so even operations which do traverse the whole list can be much faster.

Let's see how this works. We create a queue with capacity 4:

```ts
let queue = new TrackedQueue({ capacity: 4 });
```

The result is an array in memory with cells for the capacity, each of which is *empty*.

```
+---------------+
|   |   |   |   |
+---------------+
```

In practice in JS, this means that the values in the array are `undefined`. Now we add an item to the queue:

```ts
queue.pushBack(2);
```

This puts `2` in the first slot; the others remain empty:

```
+---------------+
| 2 |   |   |   |
+---------------+
  ^
```

Each time we `pushBack` another item into the queue, it adds it to the backing storage:

```ts
queue.pushBack(4);
queue.pushBack(6);
queue.pushBack(8);
```

```
+---------------+
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |
+---------------+
      ^-------^
```

Now we're out of room! If we want to introduce another item, we have to either grow the storage, which violates our goal of having the queue have a fixed size, or we have to get rid of an existing item. Since we're pushing onto the *end* of the queue, we can get rid of the item at the *beginning*. You can think of this as though we're "pushing" it out of the back of the queue:

```ts
queue.pushBack(1);
```

```
   +---------------+
 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 1 |
   +---------------+
                 ^
```

To do this with an actual array, though, we would need to copy each of the items backwards, like this:

```ts
let newStorage: T[] = [];
for (let i = 1; i < existingStorage.length; i++) {
  newStorage[i - 1] = existingStorage[i];
}
```

This means that the cost of adding new items when we are at capacity grows linearly with the size of the queue; it's always exactly *O(N-1)*. For four items, we have to copy 3 items; for 1,000 items we have to copy 999 items.

We can avoid this by using the backing array as a *ring* buffer, which will give us constant time (*O(1)*) access and push and pop operations. When we get to the end, we can wrap around it instead of moving the items within it. In that approach, if we have a full queue:

```
+---------------+
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |
+---------------+
```

...and push into it:

```ts
queue.pushBack(1);
```

...we simply replace the item at the *start* of the "ring":

```
+---------------+
| 1 | 4 | 6 | 8 |
+---------------+
  ^
```

As we add more items, we just continue to replace the existing items in the queue:

```ts
queue.pushBack(3);
queue.pushBack(5);
```

```
+---------------+
| 1 | 3 | 5 | 8 |
+---------------+
      ^---^
```

This has the same effect as rearranging the queue each time, but the cost of insertion for a new element is now constant and does not change with the size of the queue.

To make this work, we have to introduce some bookkeeping so we know where to insert new elements. Specifically, we need to know:

- the capacity of the queue, and we have to know
- the current front of the queue
- the current back of the queue

We already have the capacity from construction. For tracking the front and back of the queue, we can create two cursors: a `tail` and a `head`:

- `tail` always points to either the 0th, empty slot when the queue is empty *or* to the front of the queue
- `head` always points to the next place to insert an item, which will also be the 0th, empty slot when the queue is empty

Finally, notice that as described above, the `head` and `tail` would always overlap whenever the queue is full. That means that we would need to keep track of whether the queue is full to know whether overlapping `head` and `tail` means the queue is empty or not, which is important for knowing whether to move the `tail` when pushing to the back of the queue or not, as well as whether to pop an item from the current `tail` slot. If we give the queue's backing storage one additional slot over the capacity, then overlapping `head` and `tail` *only* happens when the queue is empty, so we get rid of that bookkeeping.

This bookkeeping is not free, but it is fixed in size: no matter how large the ring-buffer is, the bookkeeping is still just the capacity and the two pointers! This keeps the performance of enqueue and removal constant in time, rather than dependent on the size of the queue. It also keeps the queue size linear!

To see how this works, consider this sequence of pushes and pops on the front and back of the queue. Notice that throughout, the next item to insert is always simple a function of the capacity and the current cursor positions, regardless of which operation we are doing. Here `t` is the tail pointer and `h` is the head pointer.

    let queue = new TrackedQueue({ capacity: 4 });

    queue.pushStart(2);
    ```

    Multiple elements, wrapping:

    ```
    +-------------------+
    | 2 | 9 | 7 | 5 |   |
    +-------------------+
      t               h
    ```

The memory and update overhead for the cursors is constant and tiny (just a number and a single wrapping addition or subtraction operation respectively).

Read access to the array is similarly straightforward and cheap. It costs only one additional mathematical operation for access over direct array access: computing the offset from the start, using the capacity. When we want to access the third item in the queue with `queue.itemAt(someIndex)`, our backing storage can simply do `(start + someIndex) % capacity` to get the resulting index of the item.

## Adding autotracking

For the sake of using this in a Glimmer or Ember application, we want to schedule new renders whenever the queue changes. We can do this extremely cheaply: the only overhead is making the `tail` and `head` cursors `@tracked`. This lets us take advantage of the fact that the implementation *already* requires us to have these two values around for bookkeeping; it just connects that bookkeeping for the data structure to the bookkeeping for the reactivity system. This also guarantees correctness: because our bookkeeping for both is the same, if the public API works correctly, so does the reactivity layer!

If this section seems short, that's the whole point! Autotracking is a minimal-overhead system: you get smart reactivity with almost no cost.
